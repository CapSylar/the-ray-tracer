#  Ray Tracer

A small ray tracer that i wrote while reading the ray tracer challenge.

## Building
run `cmake CMakeLists.txt` to generate the makefile
then `make`

## TODO
- clean the project file structure
- add support for building scenes from XML
- clean API
- optimizations:
    - cube-ray intersection
    - children are copied around too much
    
- shapes to add
    - cones
